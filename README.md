# Trigonal curves of genus 5, canonical model


**Subject**

Projective algebraic geometry

**Geometric introduction**

For a Geometric introduction to genus five trigonal curves, please see

(Also, the Macaulay 2 code is really commented and explained).

**Programming language**

[Macaulay2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaulay2) 


**Synopsis**

Construct a random canonically embedded trigonal curve of genus five in $`\mathbb{P}^4`$.

I am using some ideas of David Eisenbud, who was testing Mark
Green's conjecture on the gonality and projective resolutions of curves.
