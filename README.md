 [Geometric introduction](Geometric-introduction.md)

**Subject**

Projective algebraic geometry

**Synopsis**

Construct a [random] canonically embedded trigonal curve of genus 5 in
its canonical projective embedding.

I am merely using the ideas of David Eisenbud, who was testing Mark
Green's conjecture on curve gonality for curves of genus 7 (I
believe). There are no new ideas involved.  

Email any suggestions to the <leyenson -at- gmail -dot- com\>, please
