<h1 class="title">Geometric introduction to trigonal curves of genus five</h1>
<p class="author">Maxim Leyenson</p>

<p>1. Let <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> be a non-hyperelliptic trigonal curve of genus five (assume for a moment that it exists). Then it has a plane model <span class="math inline">\(C&#39;\)</span> which is a quintic with a double point:</p>
<p>Indeed, let <span class="math inline">\(g_3^1 = |p + q + r|\)</span>, where the points p, q and r on <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> are distinct. Then, by the geometric Riemann-Roch theorem, the points p, q and r all belong to the same line <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> in the canonical embedding of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. (When we vary the divisor <span class="math inline">\(D = p + q + r\)</span> in the linear system <span class="math inline">\(g_3^1\)</span>, the linear span <span class="math inline">\(\langle D\rangle\)</span> varies, too, forming a ruled surface in <span class="math inline">\(P^4\)</span> containing <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. More on this in a moment; this surface is important.)</p>
<p>Now consider the linear system of hyperplanes <span class="math inline">\(|H|\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^4\)</span> and the linear subsystem <span class="math inline">\(|H - l|\)</span> of hyperplanes containing the line <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. It cuts out a linear system <span class="math inline">\(|K_C - p - q - r|\)</span> of dimension <span class="math inline">\(4 - ( \dim l + 1) = 2\)</span> and degree 8 - 3 = 5 on <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K_C - g_3^1 = g_5^2\]</span> This <span class="math inline">\(g_5^2\)</span> gives a plane model <span class="math inline">\(C&#39;\)</span> of the curve <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> which is a curve of degree 5; of course, this is just a projection of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> with the center l.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(p_a(C&#39;) = 4 \cdot 3 / 2 = 6\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(\delta(C&#39;) = p_a(C&#39;) - p_g(C&#39;) = 
6 - 5 = 1\)</span>, and thus <span class="math inline">\(C&#39;\)</span> is a singular curve with just one singularity, which is either a node or one cusp. (See Serre, "Algebraic groups and class fields" for an excellent introduction to the <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> - invariant of singular curves.)</p>
<p>2. We can now prove the existence of such a curve <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Consider a plane curve <span class="math inline">\(C&#39;\)</span> of degree 5 with one node <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. (We omit the case of a cusp.) It is clear that such a curve exists.</p>
<p>The geometric genus of <span class="math inline">\(C&#39;\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(4 \cdot 3 / 2 - 1 = 5\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> be the smooth model of <span class="math inline">\(C&#39;\)</span>. It can be constructed by blowing up the point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\rm Bl}\nolimits_p(P^2)\)</span>, and taking the proper pre-image of <span class="math inline">\(C&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is immediately clear that <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is trigonal: the linear system of lines on the plane through <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|l - p|\)</span>, gives a pencil of (effective) divisors of degree 3 on <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>3. The linears system of conics through <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on the plane, <span class="math inline">\(|2 l - p|\)</span>, cuts out a linear system of degree 10 on <span class="math inline">\(C&#39;\)</span>. The base locus of this linear system is <span class="math inline">\(2p\)</span>. By the adjunction formula for nodal curves, (cf. Enrico Arbarello, Maurizio Cornalba, Phillip Griffiths, Joseph Harris, Geometry of Algebraic Curves: Volume I, Appendix A), after removing the base point <span class="math inline">\(2p\)</span>, we get the <span><em>canonical</em> </span> linear system on <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. (For any plane nodal curve <span class="math inline">\(C&#39;\)</span>, the canonical class of its smooth model is <span class="math inline">\((d-3) l - \{\)</span> 0-cycle of nodes on <span class="math inline">\(C&#39; \}\)</span>.)</p>
<p>Note that the linear system <span class="math inline">\(|2l - p|\)</span> embeds <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\rm Bl}\nolimits_p(P^2)\)</span> as a ruled surface in <span class="math inline">\(P^4\)</span>.</p>
<p>This gives an embedding</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[i(C) \; \subset i(\mathop{\rm Bl}\nolimits(P^2)) \; \subset P^4 = |K_C|^*\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is givenby the linear system <span class="math inline">\(|2l - p|\)</span>.</p>
<p>4. note that any line <span class="math inline">\(l_0\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(P^2\)</span> via p becomes a line <span class="math inline">\(L_0\)</span> under the embedding <span class="math inline">\(i()\)</span>. (It follows, or example, from the computation <span class="math inline">\(C \cdot l_0 = p + p&#39;\)</span> for any conic <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(|2l - p|\)</span>.</p>
<p>It follows that the image <span class="math inline">\(S = \mathop{\rm Bl}\nolimits(P^2)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(P^4\)</span> is a ruled surface, with every line of the ruling giving a trisecan to the <span class="math inline">\(i(C)\)</span>. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the spanned by the trisecant lines to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>5. It is easy to see that <span class="math inline">\(S = \mathop{\rm Bl}\nolimits(P^2)\)</span> is the intersection of quadrocs through <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (and even through <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, as we will see in a moment):</p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(i(C)\)</span> is not an intersection of quadrics: for a trisecant line <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> intersects any quadric <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> at three points, <span class="math inline">\(i(p1),.., i(p3)\)</span> , and this is contained in <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> . Thus, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the intersection of quadrics through <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> .</p>
<p>6. In fact, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is clearlt the same for all the crves <span class="math inline">\(C&#39;\)</span> with node at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> . A computation with Riemann-Roch theorem gives that every <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is cut ut in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> by its own pencil of cubic hypersurfaces in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^4\)</span>. The attached program computes this pencil.</p>
